"""Template tests. Every composed example inherits these and must pass them in CI.

They encode what every submittable repo should satisfy: the manifest parses and names a
loadable, instantiable agent class with the required interface, and that agent can actually
drive a few steps of the synced environment headlessly. They pass on the bare template because
it ships a small working starting agent, so a fresh clone is green out of the box; they keep
gating composed examples in CI and a student's own edits locally.
